Cycle GAN Image Generator Project

This reposistory is for the The Introduction to Deep Learning Mini Project based on the Kaggle competition "I'm Something of a Painter Myself"

This project involves building a GAN model to create Monet-style images from a dataset of photos. The techinique I use in the project is CycleGAN. CycleGAN is an advantageous unsupervised approach for image-to-image translations where target labels are not available. It involves creating two generators and two discriminators for each directory of images and using loss calculations to update the model.

The competition is scored and evaluated based on Memorization-informed Fr√©chet Inception Distance.
